An image gallery
#Reflections
Requirements
One page, with a set of thumbnail images, and a larger image
Styled appropriately with CSS, and make use of media queries.
Use client-side JavaScript to display the larger image when a thumbnail is selected
Use client-side JavaScript to navigate between images using the keyboard (tab, enter)
Planning
ðŸŽ¯ Plan out the UI and consider the elements you'll need to include to support the stories. Will thumbnails take up space at the top, side or bottom of the page? Will they float over the image?

Building
ðŸŽ¯ Display the thumbnail images. Will you use a grid, or a list? Will you use CSS Grid or Flexbox?

ðŸŽ¯ Display the larger image. Will you use an overlay of some kind, or a section on the same page? How would it work on smaller screens?

ðŸŽ¯ Handle user interaction. Will you use event listeners on the thumbnails, or on the container? How will you know which thumbnail was selected?
